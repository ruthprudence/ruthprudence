## Summary

I take great joy in solving problems, and looking for ways to solve problems better. I approach every challenge as an opportunity to understand the core issue (some might call this "first principles" thinking), leveraging available resources and technologies to create sustainable solutions. When I think "available resources" I think of the [A-Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team), and when I say "sustainable solutions" I mean: if it doesn't work every time, it doesn't work, and it should work for *everybody*.

I achieve great success by systematically improving processes, meaning everything is always on the table when it comes to improving things (including my personal diet, habits, relationships, creations)--I own up to my failures and love leaving people and projects better than when I arrived. I am a believer in "1% improvement every day" in as many dimensions as possible.

Whether it's through code, documentation, mentorship, strategic problem-solving, or a burst of enthusiastic positivity, my goal is to create lasting beneficial impact.
